# Hyprland_Dotfiles
This repository contains my personal Hyprland dotfiles, which are tailored for my specific setup and preferences. The configuration is designed to work with the Hyprland window manager and includes various customizations for a personalized user experience.

# Installation


## Needed packages move to waybar

Nerd Fonts used for the icons in the status bar, so you need to install them first.
```
sudo pacman -S nerd-fonts-jetbrains-mono
```

Or download all Nerd Fonts 
```
sudo pacman -S nerd-fonts
```

## Rofi 
1. make executable 

```
chod +x wifi-manager.sh 
```

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
```
sudo pacman -S rofi networkmanager libnotify
``` 

3. Ensure NetworkMangager is running:
```
sudo systemctl enable --now NetworkManager

```
